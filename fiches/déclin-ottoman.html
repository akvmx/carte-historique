            <p><h1>Le déclin de l'Empire Ottoman</h1></p><p><h2>Déroulement des événements</h2></p><p>The story of its decline is long, it took centuries to complete. There are four main reasons to have in mind:</p><p>1. <strong>Logistical limits</strong>. Prior to the battle il of 1683, the ottomans had a huge empire, expanded on three continents. This meant attacks on f’various fronts; they often had to fight many opponents at the same time.
    
    1. Russo ottoman war at the same time as Austro Ottomzb.
    2. Siege of Ochakov
    3. 19th century: Battle of Shipka
    
    As a reasult, opponents could strategically declare war.
    
2. <strong>Military discrepancy</strong>. As much as multi front warfare was responsible, the increasing discrepancy compared to its European rivals, from the 18th century onwards, created a huge gap. Conservatism within its status quo killed development. Nizam I Jedid tried to imitate a European army; it was stopped. In addition, its navy also became outdated.
    
    1. Battle of Chesme ;
    2. Battle of Naverino
3. <strong>Economics</strong>. The empire had many territories, including the Silk Road, but the discovery of the Americans undermined the utility of the latter. In addition, the ottomans struggled in the 16th century with inflation, because of the Potosk silver (Price revolution). In 1589, the Beylerbeyi Event took place and impacted the economy.
    
    plus, the almost constant warfare the ottomans were in also had an impact on economy.
    
4. <strong>Nationalism</strong>. Imported from Europe, it hit the Empire especially hard: the early manifestations were in its European territoires, with the precedent of the Serbian revolution, followed by the Greece, later Montenegro, Bosnia. Nationalists leaders turned requests of autonomy into armed. The previous Millet System had been replaced by nationalism.</p>
